# SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a produt people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product.  So let's start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

# Machine Learning Algorithm used:
Linear Regression

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python language
3. Numpy library
4. Pandas - Data Cleaning
5. Matplotlib - Data Visualization
6. Seaborn - Data Visualization
7. SkLearn - Model Building
8. Microsoft Excel
9. Streamlit - Framework

# Prerequisites:
1. A prior knowledge of Python programming language along with its libraries for data science such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SkLearn is needed.
2. Installation of required libraries

# Process:
1. Import Libraries
2. Load dataset
3. Data Cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data Visualization
6. Correlation
7. Train and test split
8. Model Training
9. Model Evaluation
10. Exporting the model
11. Streamlit view
