# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFIER
Iris flower has three speices: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica, which differs according to their measurements.  Now assume that we have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here we have trained a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
