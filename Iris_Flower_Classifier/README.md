# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFIER
Iris flower has three speices: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica, which differs according to their measurements.  Now assume that we have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here we have trained a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

# Machine Learning Algorithm used:
Logistic Regression

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python language
3. Numpy library
4. Pandas - Data Cleaning
5. Matplotlib - Data Visualization
6. Seaborn - Data Visualization
7. SkLearn - Model Building
8. Microsoft Excel
9. Streamlit - Framework

# Prerequisites:
1. A prior knowledge of Python programming language along with its libraries for data science such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SkLearn is needed.
2. Installation of required libraries

# Process:
1. Import Libraries
2. Load dataset
3. Data Cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data Visualization
6. Correlation
7. Label Encoding
8. Train and test split
9. Model Training
10. Model Evaluation
