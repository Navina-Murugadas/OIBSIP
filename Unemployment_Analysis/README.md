# UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.  Hence we have done Unemployment analysis with python.

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python language
3. Numpy library
4. Pandas - Data Cleaning
5. Matplotlib - Data Visualization
